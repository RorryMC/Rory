## What is Rory?
Rory is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers.
The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible. **Please note, this project is still a work in progress and should not be used on production. Expect bugs!**

Special thanks to the Geyser project for being a trailblazer in protocol translation and for all the team members who have now joined us here!

### Currently supporting Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.100 - v1.16.210 and Minecraft Java v1.16.4 - v1.16.5. (not)





Okay, this project is actually a joke for rory.

Still.
Rory!
